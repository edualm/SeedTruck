# Seed Truck

A seedbox management application for iOS and macOS.

This is not the kind of project Apple allows on the App Store, so its source is free for anyone to use. You'll need to compile it yourself if you want to use the app, though.

## Warning

⚠️ This is an early project, still very much a work in progress.

## Roadmap

- iOS main app (currently being worked on)
- macOS support
- watchOS support

## Tests

Coming soon. Reason is that I am not being able to run them under Xcode 12, so not much point in writing them...
