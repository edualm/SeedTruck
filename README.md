# Seed Truck

A seedbox management application for the whole family of Apple devices - iOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS.

This is not the kind of project Apple allows on the App Store, so I'm open-sourcing it, hopefully it's useful for someone. You may also (and should!) use the app if you want, but you'll need to compile and install it yourself though.

It uses SwiftUI 2, and as such, can only run on iOS/tvOS 14+, watchOS 7+ and macOS 11+.

The app should be useable, but please keep in mind that it's still under active development, and won't have a tagged release until a bit after the official versions of the OS versions described above are released.

## Screenshots

These will appear eventually.

## Features

 - Connect to Transmission seedboxes (support for other types of seedboxes is easy to add, but not implemented)
 - View torrents, their status, and remove them.
 - Import torrents, either using a torrent file or magnet link.
 
iOS, tvOS and watchOS support are practically done. macOS support will only probably be worked on when macOS 11 is released.

## Tests

Coming soon. Reason is that I am not being able to run them under Xcode 12, so not much point in writing them unfortunately.
